#Groovy Examples
This project houses examples of Groovy code I have written to help better understand the myriad of features available to Groovy developers.  Some of these examples where gleaned from [Groovy In Action (2nd Edition)](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/), which was invaluable in my efforts to understand and appreciate the intricacies of Groovy.

####Where did these examples come from?
- Everything under the __gia2__ package is based on an idea or example from [Groovy In Action (2nd Edition)](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/), but with largely refactored code to more clearly express important aspects of the examples
- Everything under the __new_in_v2_3__ package is based on new features added to [Groovy 2.3](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+2.3+release+notes)
