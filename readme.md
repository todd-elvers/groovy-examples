#Groovy Examples
This project houses examples of Groovy code I have written to help better understand the myriad of features available to Groovy developers.  Some of these examples where gleaned from [Groovy In Action (2nd Edition)](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/), which was invaluable in my efforts to understand and appreciate the intricacies of Groovy.

#####Where did the examples come from?
- Everything under the _groovyInAction_ package is based on an idea or example from [Groovy In Action (2nd Edition)](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/), but with largely refactored code to more clearly express important aspects of the examples
- Things I have heard, seen or written at conferences that seemed particularly interesting
- Features or important libraries I have stumbled happened upon while writing production Groovy code
